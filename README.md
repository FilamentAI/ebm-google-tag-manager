# EBM Google Tag Manager Integration

This project provides a template so that you can integrate the EBM Chat Widget with Google Tag manager. The template only requires a hostname, and a widget ID and from that you'll be able to embed the chat widget you've created in the Chat Widget Builder on any page that is managed by Google Tag Manager. 

For documentation about the EBM Chat Widget Builder, please see the help guide contained inside your EBM instance.
